    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This application follows the theory from Chapter 9. The goal of adaptive noise\n",
    "cancellation is to remove interference from a signal of interest by means of a\n",
    "correlated noise reference signal. In this example, we consider an RF communication system consisting of an\n",
    "emitter and a receiver. These systems experience noise at the receiver that causes\n",
    "signal degradation. The interference originates from the thermal noise of the system\n",
    "and from the RF environment. The receiver measures signals of interest\n",
    "on the main channel and reference noise on a secondary channel. Since both\n",
    "channels have different propagation delays and distortions, the noise signals are\n",
    "distinct. However, the unwanted noise in the primary port and the reference\n",
    "noise are highly correlated. Therefore, it is possible to design a linear FIR filter\n",
    "that produces an estimate of the interference from the primary channel. We wish\n",
    "to use the theory of Wiener filters to recover the underlying audio signal."

No numerical values are required in this part. It is sufficient to connect the theory to the practice by explaining the meaning of all the symbols and their relation to the two measured signals: *audio_sig* and *channelNoise_sig*. Also explain how to finally recover the interference-free audio signal when the Wiener problem has been solved. **(3 points)**\n",
